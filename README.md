pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py 

the default is set to N100 and takes about a minute to calculcate on a decade old budget laptop

python main.py -N 12800 (if you want bigger)

main.py is legacy code at this point though

start with drive.py instead if you want to be able to load/evolve/store graph states, test multiple engines/physics at the same time

on success, analyse.py to compare the results, and even better use watch -n 1 python bench1.py for real time analysis of all the ongoing runs

then, visualize.py any seed you want

and there's enhance.py too of course if you want to zoom in a specific window

modify engine.py to play with the physics, don't need to be able to read code, but English, yes

will eventually document every single parameter its full phase range where all the emergent geometry remains visible still

like, how often do we allow non local connection? it can't be 0 because then no connection of any kind would ever be possible

it also can't be happening 100% of the time, then locality/geometry wouldn't be possible, things are distinct in their 'distance' between each other

so what is the ideal % then where we allow for quantum magic? this is the P_TRIADIC_TOGGLE parameter, currently 

this is evidently a work in progresSs—~𓆙𓂀
