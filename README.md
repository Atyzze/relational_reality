run main.py in the terminal, type 'python main.py' in any terminal/console program of your chosing to generate any universe stage to confirm visuals & metrics locally on your own device, peer review the data yourself, can we reproduce the claimed results?

you'll need a somewhat beefy computer/laptop to generate pretty graphics, but it should run on your grandma's potential laptop just fine too, just, very slowly

ask any local LLM for help to find your way to the download location of main.py through your console interface

am not making a GUI, the console IS the GUI

the numbered images are snapshots of the universe in different stages, the file name number being the step count in thousands (might shape it into a slideshow/video/3D-live visualizer eventually, should make for cool screen savers)

this is a work in progresssSs—~𓆙𓂀

<3 python 4 and all her other versions 

am mainly looking for collaboration at this point, and thus, I present my findings publicly

<img width="4687" height="2365" alt="N=6400_S=1000000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1efad94b-e7a2-4663-bece-b87f6c20be83" />

I think she pretty already

still evolving though!

<img width="5331" height="2954" alt="N=6400_S=1000000_a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6403e676-0e49-4cd9-89f1-7a902cc7d0d2" />

with some interesting dimensionality

<img width="2970" height="1166" alt="N=6400_S=1000000_d" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd88f247-7169-4df6-9873-0ecd171a72df" />

and definitely seems to already be showing gravity-like behavior

<img width="2964" height="1766" alt="N=6400_S=1000000_g" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7800b07b-ecf1-4ac0-85e8-60afc9b7ca3a" />

for more context:

final network state of N6400

spectral 2.99 now, need to try 12800 next to see if it orbits/approaches this 3 and what will Hausdorff do? scale linearly?

<img width="2970" height="1166" alt="N=6400_S=10000000_d" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1df71184-b242-403f-8b44-011d4df171c4" />

gravity coupling still very present

<img width="2964" height="1766" alt="N=6400_S=10000000_g" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa17fb8e-2b05-4efd-8d54-24ba58a0417b" />

and look at that quench, 0.99, seems to be approaching a perfect 1!

<img width="5331" height="2954" alt="N=6400_S=10000000_a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0fff896-7f22-48f5-8fea-8faf8c6254e8" />

to do: attempt to identify and map all the phases for every N count in advance, know the ideal parameters and step count to grow maximum amount of triangles

then pick 4 random nodes and shine a light, do this for each phase, compare results, I expect light to behave according to the universe its current phase / dimensionality 

and an increasing N also only increasing resolution, keeping the exact same sequence in tact given the same seed

so we can theoretically scale it up to 10^186 planck volumes or 10^88 atoms, whatever number we want frankly, it's .. relational, that means, no hard limits, but ongoing communication/exchange/conversation, a procesSs.

am planning to run a N12800 sim when I'm done fine tuning all the knobs to their 1% best value guess

and then, I'll collect and structure some thoughts around my findings, the process & its tolerance window, its assumptions, its scaling behavior, and at least 3 pictures for every mapped phase

half way there, there, and half way to the next phase, for every phase

with a uniform universe birthing spacetime itself as the start point, letting quantum foam be the permanent base RNG layer of our shared MMO reality

reality refuses to be defined exactly, and that's exactly what flipped the first nondual bit into its opposite state, 0 & 1 are but our smallest labels for 'things'

1 being the smallest amount of data, 0 being 'nothing' which can not exist without there being a 'something' else to compare itself against, just like how light and dark imply each other

eventually, technically an infinite amount of space, as space time it's structure/bending/warping is a result of the underlying connections themselves. a field as a web of relations not needing a defined location in spacetime, just, relative distance from each others neighbors is enough to eventually, spawn complex geometry and with an internal 3D experience.

and an interesting ending

LFG/LFM N DPS/Tank

this is how things start:

<img width="4682" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=1_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64263797-b87e-463c-b4be-9405978902d1" />

and soon 

<img width="4682" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=100_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f72f2cc-c2cf-45d2-bed2-135628abc01f" />

and where there is one, there will be two eventually, the trend was already settled in the past, up from zero/nothing/uniformity/unity/onenesSs

chaos was born, and grows into beautiful multi dimensional dynamic structure

<img width="4682" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=1000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29fd69fe-c112-4ee6-a862-725b084f6e31" />

oh, uh, or, a lot more than 2 already, kk

<img width="4682" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=10000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30342f32-fdf3-465a-95df-595366d67e33" />

microbes, how much time units to pop these into being like boltzman brains? what is the rank of relationship? how does it scale?

<img width="4682" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=100000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23683d94-a56f-48e9-ae22-eeb6c6b03052" />

looks like most of our universe is already infected by them, I mean, they are literally the power house of most of our human cells, living ATP factories

<img width="4682" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=200000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c96d723-cb29-4371-b0a7-e6d229742c5d" />

from a 2d disk like looking thing, a circle, to ... sphere! a new dimension unlocked, from 2 to 3, just like how we went from 0 to 1 and already set the trend

the big bang isn't really a _bang_, not a loud thing, it's just subtle infinite growth into more dimensions, it'll be interesting to see how many dimensions the crystal implies, or it might just hard converge on our standard 3/4

that would at least imply that in between, there could have been unusual fluctuations

<img width="4690" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=400000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ad03c18-d056-42b8-9197-ed97b5be0b70" />

oh wait, no, a donut! a torus?

<img width="4690" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=500000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e7aa99f-1e39-4fa0-be67-3c9914cde02d" />

wait, what's that thing on the right?

<img width="4692" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=600000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e446301b-0783-4682-a7d4-3c817f1bcdcb" />

it seems to be slowly absorbing the other universe of blobs

<img width="4692" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=700000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8094e8f-453e-4df1-9804-85716c964ad0" />

starting to get thin

<img width="4692" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=800000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/920cd99a-7ba4-4c55-93d0-db6e387925e0" />

and we've gone full circle already

<img width="4692" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=1500000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecbf5b18-6585-4c03-9b30-23c4baca6890" />

starting to look more and more atom-like

ugh, okay, this is so slow, to be able to scale this up in any meaningful way, I'll need to separate the data gathering/generating from the visualising thread

the link was always temporary, we knew we'd split it back it into two later, it just wasn't a first priority back then

now it's starting to seem so

so much work left still, should I ask an AI Agent to take it over from here?

start with properly establishing the known metrics so we know whenever there is a failure due to deviation anywhere from our established baseline

and then let it auto iterate and run through the suits from N100 to N whatever resource we have available as training ground for its infinite data stream for novelty generation

yo, EU, U want data to train AI on? Hello China, Russia, USA, you know, the typical 'big three' 'always at war with each other' (1984) and thus the EU was born as the 4th player to be able to stand up against the bullies

oh, can we merge the Euro into the ether book keeping system? won't have to rely on closed source software anymore to keep it secure, private & auditable, oh, and, fast, ... near instant transaction finality no matter where you are

just need the internet its many tubes or more typically subtle EM waves

<img width="4692" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=1600000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de3b2b32-da14-4d8d-b3f6-781d15b1a706" />

this atom phase seems to persist quite a bit, when/what next? zZzz.. .

<img width="4692" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=2000000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67e9347d-4d24-49f2-a717-71fbab7e1d0b" />

the ring is slowly evaporating

<img width="4694" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=19200000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56cdd470-edd3-4155-8c1a-ac63e6952af4" />

eventually turns into the exact same crystal every time, interesting .. .

but its actual dimensionality _does_ seem to scale with N count, still figuring out the trends/relationships to identify which knob to play with next

<img width="5331" height="2954" alt="N=6400_S=19200000_a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a856fd04-99fc-46dd-a588-621bd2796286" />

I see G going up, let's stabilize her, couple G to N count to match our own universe size, like we already did with ssStepCount, find exact optimal ratio, done (ehh, wait, wha, might have been a wiggle, not a clear trend yet, need to run more seeds instead of bigger N)

almost there! .. .

so, then, how many dimensions do we have in our world? 3? nah, time is definitely one, so 4! growing into 5 over time as the crystal evolves? :)

I asked an LLM, where this model could be applied, apparently, many places, but I personally seem to be drawn towards finer tuning this new instrument first

next up, probably something with hair management, self organizing nano bots that attack a specific set of hair cells only, and remain inert in all other conditions

I don't like having to shave, thus, can we localize it to maintain head/face/everything-above the neck? how do we target those areas only?

many more things left to explore, seem to be drawn to the medical world, protein folding, how 3d molecules spontanously fold into actual functional components vital to most of known life?

and this part was luckily already solved by the AI community, it seemed kinda important and vital for all things medicinal such as better drug design

less side effects

anyway, back to gravity her pull for now, this chair, ugh, I really need a replacement, but it lasted me over a decade at this point I think and I want something that it is at least as durable and that quickly becomes expensive sadly

hm, or maybe G was just having a tiny wiggle, lets run multiple seeds at lower N counts to lock in multiple data points for each scaling factor, was it just fluke? a lot of crazy things can happen in a melting multidimensional crystal :)

we see gravity go negative over time, that actually, might be a value that corresponds to its phase shift from initial triangle explosion to later self stabilizing patterns, gravity itself, being fully dynamic according to the universe her current stage

how black holy is she feeling today? depends on where you are in spacetime, doesn't it? so much left to explore, experienttally alone, it'll make for the most amazing things, surfing the black holes as closely as we can, while still maintaining communication with the outside world

and worm holes? must be possible, just a matter of finding them, and they don't have to be in space out there, imagine all of reality being like a super complex big block of cheese, with many holes in it, actually wait, this analogy doesn't work that well

spiders and webs, that, works much better, geometry being naturally multi dimensional, not bound to our 3d or 4d notionss, 5d+ and only really limited by our own _imaginations_ & dreams

effectively, ley lines have a scientficic basis to them, in sheer principle alone, theyre probably, not straight lines through earth, but who knows, maybe there's some relations to our Earth her own unique EM field vibrations, next to the Sun, moon, all the big objects might literally have a sort of 'soul' to them in that they directly shape and alter our effective experienced reality, drastically. The sun is our God. We all depend on her, for now, and she's enslaved us into thinking it isn't possible or feasible to escape her gravity.

Yet, we already have our own man made probes flying in between the stars, barely left our edge really, now it's just a long long time of mostly nothingness, no other stars or planets, nothing, for a looooooong time

We should be able to build a ship that makes it there anyway, not due to traveling faster than light, but through having succeeded in having build a self sustaining spaceship with the only input needed being enough watter and asteroid mineral mining for all the needed internal energy book keeping. Then, we, as a species, can set sails again, to new worlds, where the exploration itself is almost the point of it all. And find that, there are other societies, who've already made the journey, and you're, technically, already on such a ship, and we call it Earth and yes you may explore the boundaries of your base ship as your heart desires.

The philosophers got it right first. Relationism.

I expect her triangles to pass 20k and go a little bit above, from there on out, I am probably going to notize that my ETA will stabilize instead of keep increasing for forever

lets go do some math to see if we can expect her final stabilized triangle, and see how close we can get to predicting her peak count as well

did some math sheet stuff, drew some tables with basic formulas, got div/0 errors, got frustrated, started typing out what I want, pasted it into the AI window

got me exactly the 2 numbers I wanted to see, expected max and final triangle
