run main.py in the terminal, type 'python main.py' in any terminal/console program of your chosing to generate any universe stage to confirm visuals & metrics locally on your own device, peer review the data yourself, can we reproduce the claimed results?

you'll need a somewhat beefy computer/laptop to generate pretty graphics, but it should run on your grandma's potential laptop just fine too, just, very slowly

ask any local LLM for help to find your way to the download location of main.py through your console interface

am not making a GUI, the console IS the GUI

the numbered images are snapshots of the universe in different stages, the file name number being the step count in thousands (might shape it into a slideshow/video/3D-live visualizer eventually, should make for cool screen savers)

this is a work in progresssSs—~𓆙𓂀

<3 python 4 and all her other versions 

am mainly looking for collaboration at this point, and thus, I present my findings publicly

I think she pretty already

still evolving though!

with some interesting dimensionality

and definitely seems to already be showing gravity-like behavior

final network state of N6400

spectral 2.99 now, need to try 12800 next to see if it orbits/approaches this 3 and what will Hausdorff do? scale linearly?

gravity coupling still very present

<img width="2964" height="1766" alt="N=6400_S=10000000_g" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa17fb8e-2b05-4efd-8d54-24ba58a0417b" />

and look at that quench, 0.99, seems to be approaching a perfect 1!

tomorrow, we shall attempt to define the 4 phases for every N count in advance, know the ideal step count to grow maximum amount of triangles and predicted drop off ~25% as well
then pick 4 random nodes and shine a light, do this for each phase
and compare results, will post here when data gathered

am also running a N12800 in advance before getting the additional light cones accross all phases and multiple seeds

we're close to finishing this project and moving on to pure visualisation running on the GPU instead? :)
