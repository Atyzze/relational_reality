run main.py in the terminal, type 'python main.py' in any terminal/console program of your chosing to generate any universe stage to confirm visuals & metrics locally on your own device, peer review the data yourself, can we reproduce the claimed results?

you'll need a somewhat beefy computer/laptop to generate pretty graphics, but it should run on your grandma's potential laptop just fine too, just, very slowly

ask any local LLM for help to find your way to the download location of main.py through your console interface

am not making a GUI, the console IS the GUI

the numbered images are snapshots of the universe in different stages, the file name number being the step count in thousands (might shape it into a slideshow/video/3D-live visualizer eventually, should make for cool screen savers)

this is a work in progresssSs—~𓆙𓂀

<3 python 4 and all her other versions 

am mainly looking for collaboration at this point, and thus, I present my findings publicly

I think she pretty already

still evolving though!

with some interesting dimensionality

<img width="2970" height="1166" alt="N=6400_S=1000000_d" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd88f247-7169-4df6-9873-0ecd171a72df" />

and definitely seems to already be showing gravity-like behavior

<img width="2964" height="1766" alt="N=6400_S=1000000_g" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7800b07b-ecf1-4ac0-85e8-60afc9b7ca3a" />

final network state of N6400

spectral 2.99 now, need to try 12800 next to see if it orbits/approaches this 3 and what will Hausdorff do? scale linearly?

<img width="2970" height="1166" alt="N=6400_S=10000000_d" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1df71184-b242-403f-8b44-011d4df171c4" />

gravity coupling still very present

<img width="2964" height="1766" alt="N=6400_S=10000000_g" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa17fb8e-2b05-4efd-8d54-24ba58a0417b" />

and look at that quench, 0.99, seems to be approaching a perfect 1!

<img width="5331" height="2954" alt="N=6400_S=10000000_a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0fff896-7f22-48f5-8fea-8faf8c6254e8" />

to do: attempt to identify and map all the phases for every N count in advance, know the ideal parameters and step count to grow maximum amount of triangles

then pick 4 random nodes and shine a light, do this for each phase, compare results, I expect light to behave according to the universe its current phase / dimensionality 

and an increasing N also only increasing resolution, keeping the exact same sequence in tact given the same seed

so we can theoretically scale it up to 10^186 planck volumes or 10^88 atoms, whatever number we want frankly, it's .. relational, that means, no hard limits, but ongoing communication/exchange/conversation, a procesSs.

am planning to run a N12800 sim when I'm done fine tuning all the knobs to their 1% best value guess

and then, I'll collect and structure some thoughts around my findings, the process & its tolerance window, its assumptions, its scaling behavior, and at least 3 pictures for every mapped phase

half way there, there, and half way to the next phase, for every phase

with a uniform universe birthing spacetime itself as the start point, letting quantum foam be the permanent base RNG layer of our shared MMO reality

reality refuses to be defined exactly, and that's exactly what flipped the first nondual bit into its opposite state, 0 & 1 are but our smallest labels for 'things'

1 being the smallest amount of data, 0 being 'nothing' which can not exist without there being a 'something' else to compare itself against, just like how light and dark imply each other

eventually, technically an infinite amount of space, as space time it's structure/bending/warping is a result of the underlying connections themselves. a field as a web of relations not needing a defined location in spacetime, just, relative distance from each others neighbors is enough to eventually, spawn complex geometry and with an internal 3D experience.

and an interesting ending

LFG/LFM N DPS/Tank

this is how things start:

and soon 

<img width="4682" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=100_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f72f2cc-c2cf-45d2-bed2-135628abc01f" />

and where there is one, there will be two eventually, the trend was already settled in the past, up from zero

<img width="4682" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=1000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29fd69fe-c112-4ee6-a862-725b084f6e31" />

oh, uh, or, a lot more than 2 already, kk

<img width="4682" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=10000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30342f32-fdf3-465a-95df-595366d67e33" />

microbes, how much time units to pop these into being like boltzman brains? what is the rank of relationship? how does it scale?

<img width="4682" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=100000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23683d94-a56f-48e9-ae22-eeb6c6b03052" />

looks like most of our universe is already infected by them, I mean, they are literally the power house of most of our human cells, living ATP factories

<img width="4682" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=200000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c96d723-cb29-4371-b0a7-e6d229742c5d" />

uh oh, what's this, a virus? a ball with many tiny strings, hmmmmm, but not quite hair like, too sparse, octopus? how many arms?? or perhaps a purple star with some unusually big solar flare-y appendages

<img width="4690" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=400000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ad03c18-d056-42b8-9197-ed97b5be0b70" />

oh wait, no, a donut! a torus?

<img width="4690" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=500000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e7aa99f-1e39-4fa0-be67-3c9914cde02d" />

wait, what's that thing on the right?

<img width="4692" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=600000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e446301b-0783-4682-a7d4-3c817f1bcdcb" />

it seems to be slowly absorbing the other universe of blobs

<img width="4692" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=700000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8094e8f-453e-4df1-9804-85716c964ad0" />

starting to get thin

<img width="4692" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=800000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/920cd99a-7ba4-4c55-93d0-db6e387925e0" />

and we've gone full circle already

<img width="4692" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=1500000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecbf5b18-6585-4c03-9b30-23c4baca6890" />

starting to look more and more atom-like

ugh, okay, this is so slow, to be able to scale this up in any meaningful way, I'll need to separate the data gathering/generating from the visualising thread

the link was always temporary, we knew we'd split it back it into two later, it just wasn't a first priority back then

now it's starting to seem so

so much work left still, should I ask an AI Agent to take it over from here?

start with properly establishing the known metrics so we know whenever there is a failure due to deviation anywhere from our established baseline

and then let it auto iterate and run through the suits from N100 to N whatever resource we have available as training ground for its infinite data stream for novelty generation

yo, EU, U want data to train AI on? Hello China, Russia, USA, you know, the typical 'big three' 'always at war with each other' (1984) and thus the EU was born as the 4th player to be able to stand up against the bullies

oh, can we merge the Euro into the ether book keeping system? won't have to rely on closed source software anymore to keep it secure, private & auditable, oh, and, fast, ... near instant transaction finality no matter where you are

just need the internet its many tubes or more typically subtle EM waves

<img width="4692" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=1600000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de3b2b32-da14-4d8d-b3f6-781d15b1a706" />

this atom phase seems to persist quite a bit, when/what next? zZzz.. .

<img width="4692" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=2000000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67e9347d-4d24-49f2-a717-71fbab7e1d0b" />

the ring is slowly evaporating

<img width="4694" height="2367" alt="N=6400_S=19200000_m" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56cdd470-edd3-4155-8c1a-ac63e6952af4" />

eventually turns into the exact same crystal every time, interesting .. .

but its actual dimensionality _does_ seem to scale with N count, still figuring out the trends/relationships to identify which knob to play with next
