pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py 

the default is set to N100 and takes about a minute to calculcate on a decade old budget laptop

python main.py -N 12800

main.py is legacy code at this point

start with drive.py 

on success, analyse.py

then, visualize.py

and there's enhance.py too of course

modify engine.py to play with the physics, don't need to be able to read code, but English, yes, will eventually document every single parameter its full phase range where stable emergent geometry still self organizes & heals its universal web of connections (the entire graph)

Eventually we will get to the most optimal configuration, to push system size as high as we can get, effectively optimizing a liquid (dimension agnostic) digital memory substrate for later training. Have yet to start testing out different input signals than pure noise injected into all nodes everywhere all at the same time to simulate/mimic the cosmic background radiation (energetic echo of the big bang) and quantum-foam fluctuations (zero point energy) both at the same time. 

We can train images of cats on it, test its reproduce capabilities and compare vs a growing N to find a minimum/optimal and then remove nodes/neurons/connections and see how many we can remove while we keep monitoring its cat reproducing abilities as a first benchmark for memory/reasoning capabilities. Then, use this mini-blob/memory-configuration/graph-state as a single digital neuron-unit within another stacked/layered memory layer on top, where we again let every unit/node apply the same rules, but now scaled up and abstracted away to be in sync with each other where the internal graph of every node can help retain memory/function spread out equally accross all nodes in the most decentralized way possible for ultimate maximum resilience. Just like biology does it. Concentration gradients fluctuating, emotions physically in motion. I'm still exploring & mapping some of them.

Observe the surface area of the bottom right projection and compare the first slide with the last one. It evolves from a smooth disk into a halo and then back into a hairy ball, a stable configuration/manifold where every node/neuron/router/atom/planck-volume connects to 12 neighbors on average, their direct interface with the shared universal EM field. 

We identify multiple phase transitions on an initially always rising k_mean that overshoots 12 and then converges back to 12 from above. The network seems to encourage light hub behavior, diversity appears to help the network maintain global coherence while automatically self healing from sudden disconnects/damage/outages.. . or it's really just an expression of these 12 spheres ganging up on the central "hub" touching all 12 while they themselves have less connections, thus creating the 'hub'-like-spread of amount of neighbors. k_max so far does seem to scale up together with N size, but the convergence back to an average of 12 is seen accross all seeds & sizes. Unless I of course fiddle too much with the physics in engine.py, then it'll break and either no connections at all ever form, or, too many form and everything is connected to everything and you never get geometry which seems to thrive in the space in between. The current mechanism as documented here, seems to have found a stable in between these two extremes, with a lot of emergent geometry that was not explicitly programmed in, consistently forming the same shapes, every run, no matter what seed/size/scale of the universe I try out. The phases are all there. Reality seems to favor stability, and that structure is presented here, is demonstrated to arise naturally from pure chaos/randomness, the tiniest possible wiggles

this is evidently a work in progresSs—~𓆙𓂀 

(needs more rainbows/bright-colors and better ETA predictions for proper batch management)

images below take a long while to render (currently), higher-resolution/deeper/zoomed images to better capture and map all the phase transitions are on the way

TL;DR: The universe really seems to like the kissing number 12. How to pack many tiny energy/matter balls as efficiently as possible. To eventually be crushed by gravity into a black hole, where spacetime bends geometry, and where time becomes the 4th dimension we're all traveling through all roughly at the same constant/(relative!(relational)) speed, distributed acros 4 axis resulting in a 3d experience where any higher dimensionality is always experienced as an infinite amount of time slices here in the present going now, now now now. Planck time if you will. Discrete sometimes,  seconds/milliseconds/minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, the time scale we operate from fluctuates wildely based on our own immediate context such as age/experience + DNA & current direct circumstances. Our spawn point in space time probably started somewhere in between the first heart beat and the first breath.

Oh no, that TL;DR ended up being a lie ;( (sorry, oops)
