run main.py in the terminal, type 'python main.py' in any terminal/console program of your chosing to generate any universe stage to confirm visuals & metrics locally on your own device, peer review the data yourself, can we reproduce the claimed results?

you'll need a somewhat beefy computer/laptop to generate pretty graphics, but it should run on your grandma's potential laptop just fine too, just, very slowly

ask any local LLM for help to find your way to the download location of main.py through your console interface

am not making a GUI, the console IS the GUI

the numbered images are snapshots of the universe in different stages, the file name number being the step count in thousands (might shape it into a slideshow/video/3D-live visualizer eventually, should make for cool screen savers)

this is a work in progresssSs—~𓆙𓂀

<3 python 4 and all her other versions 

am mainly looking for collaboration at this point, and thus, I present my findings publicly
